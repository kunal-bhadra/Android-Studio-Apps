# Android Studio Apps

A compilation of all my one-page apps that I had developed on Android Studio during the first semester of my University.

## Brief Outline
### 🏀 Basketball Score Counter
A simple tracker to keep count of the scores between two teams through three/two pointers and free throws.


### 🏏 Cricket Score Tracker
Another tracker, but this is for Cricket, where you can increment the runs scored and the wickets dismissed.


### 🎉 Happy Birthday Card
A simple static card wishing a person Happy Birthday!


### 🛒 Seven Eleven Home Page
A home page of a Seven Eleven app which is a convenience store.
